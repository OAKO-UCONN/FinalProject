          Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a
          founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero.
          Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems, and upon America's
          entry into World War II, was rejected from military service despite
          several attempts to enlist. Rogers was the only recipient of the Super
          Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic
          Scientific Reserve. Determined to serve, Rogers ultimately volunteered
          for the Project Rebirth, which enhanced the frail Rogers' body to the
          peak of human physicality. Mistrusted by Colonel Chester Phillips, the
          head of the SSR, Rogers was relegated to propaganda campaigns, and was
          given the new moniker of Captain America. Rogers later joined the war
          with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated captured Allied
          prisoners of war.
