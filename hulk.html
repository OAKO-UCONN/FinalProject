          Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a
          founding member of the Avengers. As someone who was highly respected
          for his work regarding biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma
          radiation, he was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super
          Soldier Serum which created Captain America, although Ross elected not
          to inform Banner what he was creating. However, when an exposure to
          high levels of gamma radiation instead of vita radiation went awry,
          the mild-mannered scientist had found that when angered, provoked or
          excited, he would transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly
          mindless creature known as Hulk.
