          Thor Odinson is the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, a founding
          member of the Avengers, and the God of Thunder. When his irresponsible
          and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and
          Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his
          power, and banished by his father Odin to Earth. While exiled on
          Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and
          helping to save his new friends from a destructive threat sent by his
          adoptive brother Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor
          redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once
          more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.
